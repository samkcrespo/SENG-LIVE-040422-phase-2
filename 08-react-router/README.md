# React Router

# IMPORTANT NOTE

- API has been updated to V6 but we are still using V5 in the curriculum. To install V5 you must run this command: `npm install react-router-dom@5.3.0` otherwise, V6 will install by default

## Objectives

- Create a multi-page SPA
- Explain the advantages of using React Router
- Utilize the most common React router components: BrowserRouter, Route, Switch, Link, and NavLink
- Use custom hooks like `useHistory` and `useParams` to access state of the router
- Use history object to navigate pages
- Create dynamic routes 

## Deliverables

- Install and setup react router
- Use Switch and Route to set up initial routes
- Use NavLink and Router props to implement show page
- Use history.push() to navigate to show page after POST request
